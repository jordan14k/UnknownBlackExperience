  <h3> <center> Unknown Black Experience </center> </h3>
  <p> <center> The History we are taught in school is too Eurocentric that disregards the accomplishments achievements of Black inventors. 
    This website aims to shine a light in the void that the West has created on Black History. We aim to highlight Black scientists, mathematicians, engineers, 
    and inventors that have created foundational products or inventions that are in use today. 
    The overall goal is to inspire the younger black generation and show people like them making changes in the world. </center></p>
