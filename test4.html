    <h3> Biography </h3>
    <p> 
      Patricia Bath was born in 1942 in New York City in Harlem. Her father was a well-educated Trinidadian immigrant who was the first black motorman in the NYC subway.
      Her mother was of African and Cherokee descent and was home-maker until Dr. Bath and her siblings were in middle school, after which she worked as a housekeeper. 
      Dr Bath's parents both believed in the importance of being educated and well-read. Patricia Bath was able to finish highschool in only two and a half years, after
      which she did research at the Harlem Hospital Center which ended up being published. Dr. Bath then did her undergraduate degree at Hunter College later getting her
      M.D at the Howard University College of Medicine. Following med-school she did specialty training ophthalmology and cornea transplant at NYU and Columbia University.
      Early in her career she developed the field of Community Ophthalmology following her publication of a paper that demonstrated higher rates of blindness among
      African Americans, mainly due to the lack of access to proper care. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Complementing her work with Community Ophthalmology, Dr Bath founded the American Institute for the Prevention of Blindness (AIPB) whose goal is to train medical
      professionals and support the treatment of people with vision problems across the globe. Her work with AIPB took her all over the world helping in North Africa,
      South Africa and Europe. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      Another of Dr. Patricia Bath's great contributions to society was the Cataract Laserpaco Probe. This creation was meant to provide an improved, less invasive
      way to remove cataracts, a condition that many people will face in their later years. This technology became the medical standard for removal of cataracts
      in most countries around the world by 2000. In 2014 the US Patent and Trademark Office anounced that this technology had "helped restore or improve vision
      to millions of patients world wide"
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of her life in Academia, Dr Bath began an appointment at Charles R. Drew University (named after another great Black inventor in the medical field)
      and UCLA in 1974. One year later she became the first female faculty member at UCLA's Department of Ophthalmology. This great accomplishment was not without its
      drawbacks as Dr. Bath's initial office was in the basement where the lab animals were stored. She took a stand with the department stating that was "inappropriate"
      and was given a more acceptable office space. In 1983 she became the chair of the Ophthalmology Residency Training Program at jointly at Charles R. Drew and UCLA
      becoming the first woman in the United States to hold that type of position. In 1993 Dr. Bath retired from UCLA and became the first woman elected to be part
      of the UCLA Medical Center's honorary medical staff.
